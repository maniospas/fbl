# FBL

Let stakeholders hammer out the details of fairness definitions
written in basic fuzzy logic.

## :rocket: Quickstart

Clone this repository and install dependencies with 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then run the flask
application in your local machine with `pythom -m app`.

## :memo: How to use

There are two kinds of people that this app is meant
for:<br>
a) computer scientists that introduce new kinds of fairness
measures, and<br>
b) stakeholders or social scientists that
engage with stakeholders. 

The former can add new abstract fairness definitions
and performance measures. Whereas the latter can use
these abstractions as bases on which they can apply
their beliefs, namely by determining the truth values
of predicates (after they themselves decide on their
meaning) or selecting mechanisms with which to run
the truth values of predicates.
