    <h1>Fairness measures</h1>
    <p>This service contains measures of fairness that are stated in Basic fuzzy Logic (BL).
    These run by assigning truth values on base predicates and selecting the BL subclass to work in.
    After domain experts create the measures, stakeholders or their representatives can run them through this
    application based on specific belief values. Those values are unknown at conception and should be determined
    solely by the stakeholder. Thanks to the logical system of BL, definitions of fairness
    are rewritten either mathematically or in humanly readable language. This bridges the gap between
    crisp numerical analysis and intuitive but abstract statements.</p>
